In Winterfell, Theon tries to convince his men to fight Robb's army, but is knocked unconscious by them, who decide to leave. A dying Luwin convinces Brandon's party to go to the Wall. Arya, having escaped Harrenhal with Hot Pie and Gendry, receives the gift of a valuable coin from H'ghar, who magically changes his face.
